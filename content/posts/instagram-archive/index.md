One downside of quitting Instagram is that there’s no easy way to look back at my posts. It feels like I’ve lost a chapter of my life since it was where I used to share life updates. To preserve those memories, I decided to upload photos and videos from Instagram to my own domain. As the title suggests, I intend to treat it as an archive so I won't be uploading any new posts there. Feel free to take a look and catch a glimpse of my life from 2017 to 2022.
