In our literature classroom in high school, there used to be a wall with magnetic word pieces that you could use to make poems. It was called [Magnetic Poetry](https://magneticpoetry.com/collections/essentials/products/original-kit) and I remember we had so much fun writing weird poems. I recently came across [this photo](https://www.facebook.com/share/1EPmVE52ib/) and thought it would be fun to have one at home too.

```txt
I breathe hard when we bathe ferociously at night
with your manly father and sister & brother
but it is a secret
never ask y we did it
```

So I purchased one last week and put it up on the metallic cover of my fan coil unit. This is a poem I wrote this morning. It's a fun little activity to do while having my morning coffee. I realized that I have far fewer words than the set we had in high school. I'll need the expansion packs to come up with poems as scandalous as the one we wrote back then.

```txt
pink dream whispers roses and death
recall those days when the water was sweet
the moon swimming in the sky singing time and beauty
if it will all blow away with the wind like a spring petal
why did we cry like life always shines black
```
