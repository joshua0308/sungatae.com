TIFF Bell Lightbox Cinema 3 Toronto, ON

The movie starts off with upper class young adults in their early 20s sharing thoughts about philosophy, life, love and other worldly things. Then enters Tom who by chance gets invited to this rich kids' hangout. He declares he is a socialist and is unfettered by the pretentious snobby atmosphere of the group. With a little back and forth, Nick is intrigued by Tom and takes him under his wing. Tom is in a setting that he despises ideologically but soon gets accustomed to it. The "ironic unfortunate" himself.

I like how little it took to turn Tom and Charlie, who acted like they were so woke and enlightened in their own opposing ways, to become like kids again chasing after Audrey. All you can think of is that someone you connected with. Someone who cares about you. Who understands you. Someone who won’t judge you for what you say or believe but listens to all what you have to say. Ideologies, prejudice, ego fade away. That someone is who I’m looking for.

I also like Nick who jokes around a lot but straight to the point when necessary. He tells Tom that he is the "unfortunate one", but also accepts him more than anyone else. He likes to appear strong and fearless, but is actually a cynic who sincerely fears that he will get killed by his stepmother. He makes up stories but not because he is a liar but because he is softhearted. The stories were too cruel for him to dare speak as if they actually happened.
